        <h2>~About~</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Amy! I'm a 2nd year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.</p>

          <p>I went into engineering because I believe that technology is the great equalizer. If we cannot do, then
          we build something that can. As Archimedes said, “give me a lever and a place to stand and I will move the
          world.” It’s the humanity in creating that interests me; I want to make things that can help people.</p>

          <p>As such, I’m committed to increasing accessibility to technology and education in my community. I've been
            designing and building prototypes since middle school and have run mentorship programs for children and
            seniors alike. I've picked up various hard skills like rapid prototyping with machine shop tools, soldering,
            3d printing, etc. and about programming websites, apps, writing to potential sponsors, or even reading
            legal documents. In that time, I've been lucky enough to learn an exceptional amount about rising to failures
            with resolve, building products with empathy, and working with people from all walks of life.</p>

          <p>The culture of a team is incredibly important to me. I co-founded the FIRST robotics team at my high school
            and I know how much effort it takes to make a bunch of strangers into a tight-knit team that trusts and
            supports each other in the face of any hardship. Creating such a dynamic is what I consider one of my
            greatest accomplishments, and every time I come back as a mentor I am proud of how the team is grown. That
            kind of compassionate but challenging environment is what I look for as a sign of a strong team and strong
            company.</p>
